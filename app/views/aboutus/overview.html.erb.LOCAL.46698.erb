      Welcome to Creative… A place that brings idea generation to life.  Whatever promotional direction you desire, Creative is here to lead you to unique and imaginative ideas that are perfect for your brand.  Our unsurpassed clientele list speaks for itself; partnering with brands such as the NHL, NFL, Facebook, KFC, Schick, Energizer, Absolut, Geico, Unilever, Kimberly Clark, P&amp;G, and many more.  They have all taken advantage of the new Creative strategy.<br><br>
      We believe we have a unique approach to the promotional industry, as we see ourselves as an extension of an ad agency where we think of the promotional items and programs that would best fit the current campaign, (internally or externally) or a program wrapped around a new product launch.  This approach has been very successful as most of our clients see the value of having someone thinking of ideas for them on a daily basis and coming up with concepts without necessarily having a project to wrap it around.  Creative is your connection to truly identifying your brand by defining who you are in ways you never dreamed of.  We believe in our award winning team of professionals that have been doing just that for the past 30 years.  With our team’s industry expertise, you can relax and leave the details to us!<br><br>
      Creative Promotional Products is in the business of manufacturing and selling products in the promotional and retail markets.<br><br>
      Our corporate office is in Skokie, Illinois, with an overseas office and manufacturing warehouse in Hong Kong.  We have grown from a three-person operation 30 years ago, to a company of more than 50 people by carefully listening to, understanding, and fulfilling the needs of our clients.  We are a highly recognized supplier within the promotional products industry, and have access to the highest quality custom and stock items.  Over the past 30 years we have developed relationships with factories in the United States, Asia and Europe, that enables us to satisfy the unique and specialized needs of our clients.<br><br>
      As evidenced by our long history of successfully servicing many large-volume customers, we promise to provide the best service at the most competitive pricing.</p>

        <p>The new tequila brand, Avion, came to us looking for a way to remind bartenders, many of whom were more familiar with more established brands of tequila, to use Avion.  While the brand enjoyed a lot of celebrity by being featured on the TV show Entourage, most consumers did not realize the brand was real. Avion needed a campaign that would urge bartenders to use Avion, therefore spreading its existence to the masses.</p>
